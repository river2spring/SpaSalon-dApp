# SpaSalon-dApp
Final Project for Build On Scroll Bootcamp

~ Problem or Opportunity ~ 

Problem: A spa salon is about to lose a lot of its customers due to a privacy problem. When you apply from their website, everyone can see which treatment you apply for and most of the patients do not want to share their skin problems publicly. This problem decreases the salonâ€™s profit.

Opportunity: Creating a decentralized appointment system that ensures privacy using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), while still allowing the salon to showcase the popularity of its treatments.
